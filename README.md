UltraHardcore
-------------

UltraHardcore is a plugin for [CanaryRecode](http://canaryrecode.net).

This plugin allows you to play UltraHardcore on your CanaryRecode server. UltraHardcore is a special gamemode for Minecraft that changes many things, including:

* Health no longer regenerates automatically, the only way to regain health is with a golden apple or health potion
* Golden apples now require gold ingots to craft instead of gold nuggets
* Glistering melons (used to brew health potions) now require a gold block instead of a gold nugget to craft
* Ghasts now drop gold ingots instead of ghast tears

This plugin is not yet complete, and is still in development.
